# printf Project

In this project, we learnt how to create our own `0-print_f` function. We were tasked to implement the same concept of the standard library `printf` as guided by the Linux man page [`printf(3)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html). It contains several edge cases to test around output conversion according to a format.
